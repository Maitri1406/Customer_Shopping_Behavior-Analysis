# Customer_Shopping_Behavior-Analysis
 Analyzed customer purchasing patterns using Python, SQL, and Power BI. Cleaned and transformed data with Pandas, created customer segments, and built an interactive dashboard showing revenue trends, age-group insights, category performance, and key business KPIs.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding customer behavior, spending patterns, and category-wise performance.Using Python, I cleaned and transformed the dataset, prepared analytical tables, and calculated KPIs such as:
 - Average Purchase Amount
 - Average Review Rating
 - Customer Subscription Split
 - Revenue by Age Group 
 - Revenue by Product Categ ory
 - Sales Trends

The processed dataset was then imported into Power BI / Excel to create an interactive dashboard that highlights consumer trends, insights, and business-focused metrics.

# Technology Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning, preprocessing, aggregation
- Matplotlib – Visual representation of key metrics
- SQL – Data extraction & analytical queries
- Excel – Data formatting & review
- Power BI – Dashboard creation, interactive visuals & KPIs
- DAX – Custom measures (revenue, averages, segmentation)

# Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python + Pandas + Numpy)

- Handling missing values
- Duplicate removal
- Creating age-group categories
- Extracting features like review score metrics, purchase frequency metrics
- Merging customer, product, and order data
- Separating tables for analysis (age-based, category-based, subscription-based)
- Exporting cleaned datasets for Power BI dashboarding

# Dashboard Overview

Below is the Customer Behavior Dashboard created using Power BI/Excel.
The dashboard highlights key KPIs and visual insights, including:
- Average Purchase Amount
- Average Review Rating
- Number of Customers
- Sales by Age Group
- Revenue by Category
- Customer Distribution by Subscription Status
- Filters for gender, subscription, category

These visuals help users easily understand customer behavior, compare revenue segments, and identify trends across product categories and age groups. The dashboard is designed to support decision-making for marketing, sales, and customer engagement strategies.
